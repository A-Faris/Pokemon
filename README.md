## Background

We've been hired by a Pokémon superfan to build an API for an upcoming gaming tournament. They've given us some information in JSON format - and we have to provide a backend to send back information to help the players.

They've asked for the following requirements:

- Easily access all Pokémon
- Be able to find all Pokémon by ID
- Be able to find all Pokémon of a certain type
- Be able to find the type of a specific Pokémon
